					NASA’s human lunar exploration plans under the Artemis program call
					for sending the first woman and next man to the surface of the Moon by
					2024 and establishing sustainable exploration by the end of the
					decade. The agency will use what we learn on the Moon to prepare for
					humanity's next giant leap – sending astronauts to Mars. Working with
					U.S. companies and international partners, NASA will push the
					boundaries of human exploration forward to the Moon and on to Mars.
					NASA is working to send the first woman and next man to the Moon by
					2024 as part of the Artemis program and establish a permanent human
					presence there within the next decade to uncover new scientific
					discoveries and lay the foundation for private companies to build a
